# Project 3 : BST
### Made for MSU data structures course fall 2019

### Instructions I was given for this homework project (full PDF in files)
Attention!!! We will not use the templated stack class for this assignment.
For this assignment you must implement a BST which stores strings. Your BST must implement all size of
the basic operations we have talked about in class.
You should then write a program that allows a user to interact with an instance of the BST you have
implemented. This program should implement a text-based interface that allows the user to:
1. Create an empty BST. This should warn the user they are deleting the existing BST and ask them
if they wish to proceed. Remind the user they can save the contents of their BST to a file.
2. Insert a string into the current BST.
3. Search for a string in the current BST.
4. Remove a string from the current BST.
5. Output the in-order traversal of the current BST.
6. Output the pre-order traversal of the current BST.
7. Output the post-order traversal of the current BST.
8. Save the post-order traversal of the current BST to a user specified filename.
9. Exit.
Make certain you inform the user of the available commands and any information pertaining to the
state of the system such as whether or not a BST has been created, the number of nodes in the BST, etc. 
This is an individual assignment. Seeking direct help from students, tutors, and websites
such as chegg or stack overflow will be construed as a violation of the honor code
